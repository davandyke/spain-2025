These places are popular with walkers and a good way to meet fellow pilgrims before starting the Camino.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nDaily Summary — Sept 29\nThe travel into Galicia was a bit of an adventure. My flight into Madrid was delayed, which made me miss my original train. I caught a later one, but even that got interrupted because wildfires had closed part of the tracks, so we all had to switch to a bus for the last stretch. By the time I finally made it to Sarria about 9:30 pm, I was ready to settle in. I checked into my hostel and had a pilgrim dinner with a new friend from Salamanca who arrived around the same time. The meal was classic Galician: caldo gallego, Estrella beer, and roasted pork. Galicia is famous for its rain, but so far the weather has been unexpectedly kind. I also got my pilgrim credential and my very first stamp—fittingly, at the restaurant where I ate dinner.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDay 3 (Sept 30): Sarria → Portomarín (~22 km)\n\nCross the Miño River into Portomarín, where the Church of San Nicolás was relocated stone by stone when the original town was flooded for the Belesar reservoir.\nOvernight: Pensión Albergue Gonzar\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nDaily Summary — Sept 30\nFirst walking day on the Camino: Sarria to Portomarín, about 22 km. We set out before the sun because my walking partner didn’t have reservations and needed to be sure to claim one of the first-come beds. The trail was wrapped in fog almost the whole morning until the sun finally burned through. Along the way we met another pilgrim from Madrid who decided to join us after overhearing Guillermo joke that the village we were passing looked like something straight out of the Resident Evil video game. We stopped for a pilgrim breakfast at Mirador da Brea, then pushed on to Portomarín.\nWhen I got to my hostel, I did the usual Camino routine: shower, laundry in the sink, and then a much-needed nap. Later in the afternoon I wandered through the old town of Portomarín, which was rebuilt stone by stone on higher ground after a dam project flooded the original village in the 1960s. Now I’m back on the albergue patio with a café con leche, enjoying the quiet before heading out for dinner.\n\n\n\nDay 4 (Oct 1): Portomarín → Palas de Rei (~25 km)\n\nPass historic pilgrim hospices at Hospital de la Cruz and end in Palas de Rei, whose Church of San Tirso preserves remarkable medieval carvings.\nOvernight: Albergue San Marcos\n\nDay 5 (Oct 2): Palas de Rei → Arzúa (~29 km)\n\nOften stop in Melide, famous for pulpo a la gallega (octopus) and the Romanesque church at Leboreiro.\n\nArzúa is known for its cheese production and nearby Ribadiso hosts a medieval pilgrim hospital.\nOvernight: Cruce de Caminos Arzúa\n\nDay 6 (Oct 3): Arzúa → O Pedrouzo (~19 km)\n\nEn route visit the chapel of Santa Irene and experience the atmosphere of anticipation in O Pedrouzo as pilgrims gather for the final day.\nOvernight: Albergue REM\n\nDay 7 (Oct 4): O Pedrouzo → Santiago (~20 km)\n\nHighlights include Lavacolla, the traditional cleansing site, Monte do Gozo offering panoramic views of Santiago, and attending the Pilgrim’s Mass featuring the Botafumeiro.\nCollect Compostela certificate in Santiago.\n\nOvernight: Pensión Rua Nova (Rúa Nova, 4, Santiago de Compostela).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFull day in Santiago.\n\nMorning: Pilgrim’s Mass and/or cathedral museum/rooftop tour.\n\nAfternoon: wander the old town, Alameda Park, and relax at a café.\n\nEvening tapas crawl on Rúa do Franco.\n\nOvernight: Pensión Rua Nova (Single room with private bathroom, free Wi-Fi, pedestrian old town location).\n\n\n\n\n\nDecision point: Reassess energy and weather on the evening of Oct 4 (after arrival in Santiago) to decide whether to overnight in Finisterre or remain in Santiago\nMorning bus to Finisterre (~2.5 hrs).\n\nExplore the fishing port, beach, and town.\n\nEvening walk to Cabo Fisterra lighthouse for sunset at the “end of the world.”\n\nOvernight: Finisterre (book in Santiago if weather/energy permit) OR third night in Santiago — decision to be made after arrival.\n\n\n\n\n\nMorning in Finisterre — coffee in town or short coastal stroll.\n\nMidday bus back to Santiago (~2.5 hrs).\n\n11:48 — Depart Santiago (AVE 04314, Confort, seat 4D, Booking Reference: KYC3XB).\n\n14:50 — Arrive Madrid Chamartín.\n\nEvening tapas crawl in La Latina or Malasaña.\n\nOvernight: Petit Palace Plaza Mayor\n\n\n\n\n\n08:30 am — Arrive at Madrid Barajas T4 (recommended 3 hrs before departure, take Cercanías train from central Madrid).\n\nFrom Petit Palace Plaza Mayor:\n\nWalk ~5 min to Sol station.\n\nTake Cercanías C3 or C4 northbound to Chamartín (~10 min).\n\nAt Chamartín, transfer to Cercanías C1 or C10 directly to Barajas T4 (~15–20 min).\n\nTotal travel time ~40 min including transfer.
